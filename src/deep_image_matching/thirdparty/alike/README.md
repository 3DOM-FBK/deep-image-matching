# ALIKE: Accurate and Lightweight Keypoint Detection and Descriptor Extraction

ALIKE applies a differentiable keypoint detection module to detect accurate sub-pixel keypoints. The network can run at 95 frames per second for 640 x 480 images on NVIDIA Titan X (Pascal) GPU and achieve equivalent performance with the state-of-the-arts. ALIKE benefits real-time applications in resource-limited platforms/devices. Technical details are described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.02906.pdf).

## 1. Prerequisites

The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` :

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## 2. Models

The off-the-shelf weights of four variant ALIKE models are provided in `models/` .



## 3. Run demo

```shell
$ python demo.py -h
usage: demo.py [-h] [--model {alike-t,alike-s,alike-n,alike-l}]
               [--device DEVICE] [--top_k TOP_K] [--scores_th SCORES_TH]
               [--n_limit N_LIMIT] [--no_display] [--no_sub_pixel]
               input

ALike Demo.

positional arguments:
  input                 Image directory or movie file or "camera0" (for
                        webcam0).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model {alike-t,alike-s,alike-n,alike-l}
                        The model configuration
  --device DEVICE       Running device (default: cuda).
  --top_k TOP_K         Detect top K keypoints. -1 for threshold based mode,
                        >0 for top K mode. (default: -1)
  --scores_th SCORES_TH

### Evaluation on Hpatches

- Download [hpatches-sequences-release](https://hpatches.github.io/) and put it into `hseq/hpatches-sequences-release`.
- Remove the unreliable sequences as D2-Net.
- Run the following command to evaluate the performance:
  ```shell  
  python hseq/eval.py
  ```
